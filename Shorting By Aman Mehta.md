# Sorting Algorithms By Aman Mehta 

Welcome to the Sorting Algorithms Repository! This repository is dedicated to various sorting algorithms used in Data Structures and Algorithms. Whether you're learning about sorting algorithms or looking for code examples to understand their implementation and performance, this repository aims to provide valuable resources for your journey.

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithm Implementations:** Code examples and explanations for various sorting algorithms.
- **Time Complexity Analysis:** Analysis of time complexity for each sorting algorithm.
- **Space Complexity Analysis:** Analysis of space complexity for each sorting algorithm.
- **Visualizations:** Visualization of sorting algorithms for better understanding.

## Contents

### Sorting Algorithms

Explore the `Sorting_Algorithms` directory for implementations of various sorting algorithms. Some of the algorithms included are:

1. **Bubble Sort**
2. **Selection Sort**
3. **Insertion Sort**
4. **Merge Sort**
5. **Quick Sort**
6. **Heap Sort**
7. **Counting Sort**
8. **Radix Sort**
9. **Bucket Sort**
10. **Shell Sort**

Each algorithm implementation includes code files, time and space complexity analysis, and comments explaining the algorithm's logic.
